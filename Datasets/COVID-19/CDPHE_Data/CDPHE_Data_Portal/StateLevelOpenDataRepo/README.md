# Data from CDPHE "State Level Open Data Repository"

From [https://data-cdphe.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cdphe-covid19-state-level-open-data-repository](https://data-cdphe.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cdphe-covid19-state-level-open-data-repository)



Is this deprecated and replaced by "expanded state data"?
