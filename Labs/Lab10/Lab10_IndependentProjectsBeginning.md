# Beginning Independent Projects

There are no formal exercises for lab 10.  Instead, this week's period will be devoted to giving you time to think about beginning your independent project.

Sam will begin with a very brief PowerPoint presentation and then you will have the remaining class time to explore "[Assignment 8](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/main/Assignments/08_Independent_Project_Step1.md)", which is the first step of the Independent Project.
